# Eagles Edge Stopgap

This is a quick static landing page/microsite to hold the client off while we build a full site. This site was started on a Wednesday and had to be up by EoD Friday, so it's very MVP-ish.

_I don't recommend forking or cloning this repo, you should create a new one from scratch using the [GatsbyJS Default Starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default); the same starter from which this project was bootstrapped._
