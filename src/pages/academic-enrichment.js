            <h2>Geometry</h2>
            <p>This course offers a full year of geometry for the student who wishes to complete geometry in the summer in order to advance to Algebra II the following school year. This course is condensed into 30 hours of instruction and demands the full dedication and commitment of the student. Substantial work must be completed outside of class time in order to master the necessary topics. Students are required to have completed a full year of Algebra I with a high final average, and must also have the recommendation of their Algebra I teacher in order to take this class. An exam will be administered at the end of the class; students will receive a grade, however, no credits will be assigned. For students who do not attend St. John's, a certificate will be mailed to their school showing the attendance record and final exam grade. Students are required to have a graphing calculator. The teacher will provide geometry textbook by Larson, Boswell, Kanold, Stiff: McDougal Littell, Boston, 2004 on CD.</p>
